# TODO:
- [X] File Upload instead of bytes
- [X] Remove quorum checks in writes and reads
- [X] Handle case of no node in the ring (Important for add node function, for the put, get functions, do some checks and return false with this message)
- [X] Make the add node synchronous (i.e. dont allow add nodes repeatedly, wait for final OK response before adding new node) 
    - [X] Form should reset after added
    - [X] Form should wait until a new node is added, introduce loading symbol.
- [ ] Remove virtual nodes mapping, physical node mappings (Control Panel doesnt need to know) -> TBD
- [X] Add functions for testing admin image upload and admin image view [Possibly try to use the existing functions to mimic this]
- [X] Made a frontend for viewing images
- [ ] Figure out whether we should store connections directly or just ip/port combo
- [ ] Add automatic tests for the functions implemented [using pytest]
- [ ] Propogate the errors in functions back to the UI (for both interface and the final app)
- [ ] Understand how the js scripts work (what exactly is ws and stuff)
